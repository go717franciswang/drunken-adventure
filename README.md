### Capture and rate a physical slap
1. In the simplest model, all force are measure in the Z-axis.
   So we can get integral of acceleration to get maximum speed.

### TODO
* [x] Record max speed
* [ ] Distinguish between a swing and a back swing
* [ ] UI
* [ ] Animation

### Reference
* [Motion recognition with Android devices], focused on using raw acceleration = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}-g
